        <h1>My Immortal</h1>
        <h5>Evanescence</h5>
            <p>I'm so tired of being here
                Suppressed by all my childish fears
                And if you have to leave
                I wish that you would just leave
                'Cause your presence still lingers here
                And it won't leave me alone <br> <br>
                These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real
                There's just too much that time cannot erase <br> <br>
                When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
                When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
                And I held your hand through all of these years
                But you still have all of me <br> <br>
                You used to captivate me by your resonating light
                Now, I'm bound by the life you left behind
                Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
                Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me <br> <br>
                These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real
                There's just too much that time cannot erase
            </p>
